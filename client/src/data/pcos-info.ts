      "PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels.",
      "The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs. The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but early diagnosis and treatment, along with weight loss, may reduce the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease."
