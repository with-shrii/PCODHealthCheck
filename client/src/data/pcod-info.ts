      "PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It's characterized by the formation of multiple small cysts in the ovaries, irregular periods, and hormonal imbalances.",
      "In PCOD, the ovaries produce higher than normal amounts of male hormones (androgens), which can interfere with the development and release of eggs during ovulation. This hormonal imbalance can lead to various symptoms and health concerns."
