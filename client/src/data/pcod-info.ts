      "PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a condition in which a woman's hormones are out of balance. Women with PCOD may have higher than normal male hormone levels and irregular periods. According to Healthline, PCOD causes small fluid-filled sacs to develop in the ovaries, which can affect normal ovulation.",
      "PCOD is a common hormonal disorder, affecting 5-10% of women in their childbearing years. While similar to PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome), PCOD is generally considered a milder condition with better treatment outcomes."
