Polycystic Ovary Disorder/Syndrome (PCOD/PCOS), a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, can be a challenging condition to navigate. However, making informed dietary choices can play a crucial role in managing its symptoms and promoting overall well-being. In this article, we’ll explore the best diet plan for PCOD, including foods to eat and avoid, to help you take control of your health and fertility.

## What’s the Link Between PCOD and Diet?

**[PCOD is characterised by hormonal imbalances](https://birlafertility.com/blogs/pcos-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/), particularly high androgen levels and insulin resistance.** These imbalances can lead to a range of symptoms, including irregular periods, weight gain, excessive hair growth, acne, and difficulty conceiving. By following a PCOD-friendly diet, you can help address these [hormonal imbalances](https://birlafertility.com/blogs/hormonal-imbalance-in-women/) and alleviate your symptoms.

## Foods to Include in Your PCOD Diet Plan

When creating a **diet chart for PCOD**, focus on nutrient-dense foods that help stabilise blood sugar levels, maintain a healthy weight, and support hormone balance. Here are some key food groups to include:

### High-Fibre Foods

**Incorporating high-fibre foods into your diet can help regulate your [blood sugar levels](https://birlafertility.com/blogs/fertility-and-diabetes/) and promote weight management.** Some excellent options include:

- Brown rice
- Quinoa
- Whole wheat bread
- Lentils and beans
- Broccoli and cauliflower
- Spinach

#### **Easy PCOD-Friendly Recipe: Veggie Oats Upma**

_In a pan, sauté mixed veggies (carrots, peas, and bell peppers) in 1 tsp olive oil, then add 1/2 cup roasted oats. Pour in 1 cup of water, season with salt and turmeric, and cook until the oats are soft. Garnish with fresh coriander._

_This fiber-rich dish helps balance blood sugar and manage PCOD symptoms._

### Lean Protein Sources

Protein is essential for maintaining your muscle mass and keeping you feeling full and satisfied. Opt for lean protein sources such as:

- Fish (tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel)
- Tofu
- Lentils
- Skinless poultry

#### **What People Want to Know!**

_**Can I eat chicken and eggs if I have PCOD?**_ Absolutely! Skinless poultry, like chicken, is a fantastic lean protein that fits right into a PCOD-friendly diet. It keeps you full without the extra fats. And eggs? They’re not just good—they’re egg-cellent! Packed with protein and essential nutrients, eggs are a perfect way to power up your meals. So, go ahead and enjoy both, guilt-free!

### Low-Glycemic Index Carbohydrates

Choose carbohydrates that have a low glycemic index, meaning they are absorbed more slowly and don’t cause rapid spikes in blood sugar. Some good options include:

- Sweet potatoes
- Quinoa
- Steel-cut oats
- Whole-grain pasta

### Antioxidant-Rich Fruits

Fruits high in antioxidants can help support detoxification processes and reduce inflammation. **Low-glycaemic fruits work the best for PCOD, as they’re loaded with antioxidants and fibre that help keep your blood sugar in check.** You should conisder adding these fruits to your PCOD diet:

- Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
- Cherries
- Kiwis
- Apples
- Pears

### Green Leafy Vegetables

Green leafy vegetables are packed with nutrients that can help control hormonal imbalances and support weight loss. Make sure that your diet includes greens like:

- Kale
- Spinach
- Broccoli
- Bitter gourd

### Herbal Teas

Certain herbal teas can be beneficial for managing PCOD symptoms. Consider swapping out _chai_ for one of these options:

- Spearmint tea (rich in anti-androgens)
- Green tea (high in antioxidants and may improve insulin sensitivity)

### Healthy Fats

Healthy fats can help lower inflammation and support hormone balance. Include sources of healthy fats in your diet, for example:

- Avocados
- Almonds and walnuts
- Flaxseeds and chia seeds

## Foods to Avoid in a PCOD Diet

Just as important as knowing what foods to eat when you have PCOD is understanding what foods to avoid in a PCOD diet. Here are some food groups to avoid or eliminate from your diet completely:

### Refined Carbohydrates and Sugars

Refined carbohydrates and added sugars can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and exacerbate insulin resistance. Avoid or limit:

- White bread, pasta, and rice
- Sugary snacks and desserts
- Sweetened beverages

### Processed and Fried Foods

**Processed and fried foods are often high in unhealthy fats and empty calories, which can contribute to [weight gain](https://birlafertility.com/blogs/how-can-obesity-impact-fertility/) and inflammation.** Steer clear of:

- Packaged snacks and junk food
- Fast food
- Deep-fried items

### Dairy Products

Some women with PCOD may be sensitive to dairy products, which can contribute to inflammation. If you suspect dairy is a trigger for you, consider limiting or eliminating:

- Milk
- Cheese
- Yogurt
- Ice cream

## Fertility Boosters for People with PCOD

If you’re looking to conceive, incorporating certain foods and nutrients into your **PCOD diet chart for pregnancy** can help support fertility and your consequent [chances of becoming pregnant](https://birlafertility.com/blogs/how-to-conceive/). Here are some useful tips:

1. Increase your intake of folate-rich foods, such as leafy greens, lentils, and fortified whole grains, to support healthy foetal development.
2. Incorporate omega-3 fatty acids from sources like fatty fish (salmon, sardines) and flaxseeds to help regulate hormones and reduce inflammation.
3. Ensure adequate vitamin D intake through sunlight exposure, fortified foods, or supplements, as vitamin D deficiency has been linked to **[PCOD and infertility](https://birlafertility.com/blogs/pcos-and-infertility/).**
4. Limit caffeine and alcohol consumption, as both can negatively impact fertility.

## Lifestyle Changes to Complement Your PCOD Diet

In addition to following a **PCOD-friendly diet**, making certain lifestyle changes can further support your health and fertility:

1. Engage in regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week to help manage weight and improve insulin sensitivity.
2. Practice [stress-reduction techniques](https://birlafertility.com/blogs/managing-stress-during-infertility-treatment/), such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga, to help balance hormones and promote overall well-being.
3. Prioritise sleep, aiming for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support hormone regulation and weight management.
4. Work with a healthcare professional to monitor your progress and make adjustments to your diet and lifestyle as needed.

#### Word from the Expert:

> Remember, everyone’s journey with PCOD is different. Be patient with yourself as you make dietary changes. Listen to your body, and let food be your ally in managing your symptoms and supporting fertility. ~ [_**Deepika Mishra**_](https://birlafertility.com/doctor/dr-deepika-mishra/)
